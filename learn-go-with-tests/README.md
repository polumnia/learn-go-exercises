This is my adventure in exploring Go language and practising test driven development (TDD) by following [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests). 

## TDD process
 - Write a failing test and see it fail so we know we have written a relevant test for our requirements and seen that it produces an easy to understand description of the failure
 - Writing the smallest amount of code to make it pass so we know we have working software
 - Then refactor, backed with the safety of our tests to ensure we have well-crafted code that is easy to work with
